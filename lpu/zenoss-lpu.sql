DISCLAIMER: USE THE SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK
This script modifies the registry and several system access permissions. Use with caution!

You must set the LPUuser variable before script will execute.

example:

SET @LPUuser = 'ZENLABS\Zenny'   <---- Domain user account
SET @LPUuser = 'SQL1\Benny'     <---- Local Windows account
SET @LPUuser = 'kenny'          <---- SQL Server Account

** NOTE: This script will not create users. It will only add existing users to the 
required access areas. If you are using a local SQL account you must create that first.
